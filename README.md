- Created new "stealth" folder for our login pages, i.e., login.html, new-user.html, manage-pics.html
- Updated navbar on all remaining non-login pages removing "Login" link
- Page login.html: new-user.html link added and form action set to manage-pics.html
- Page new-user.html: Form action set to manage-pics.html. Please add name, address, phone, etc. for user sign-up.
- Page manage-pics.html: No changes made other than updating where links point to (as done with other files too).
